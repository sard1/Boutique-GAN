Welcome to Boutique GAN, an AI-assisted ethereal streetwear storefront. 

Using the popular image neural network ArtBreeder and four popular shoe styles, we designed footwear for all styles and situations. 

This point-of-sale app allows you to browse, add items to a cart, and "check out" with cash or a credit card.

We plan to expand the store with randomly generating additions to our product line, using the Artbreeder API. 

The Boutique GAN was developed as a group by Joseph Sardashti, Kris Juncaj, and Alejandra Roel, using Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
